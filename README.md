This project was commisioned by the SoundPound group with a brief to create a tool that will match an entered postcode with one of their credit unions eligible for a Green Finance loan

After working with the Soundpound team to find out exactly what they wanted in the brief and how they wanted the design to look, and after feedback from previous bee network project, i implemented the changes and updated the theme slightly to match the idea of a green finance loan. 

It was shared directly with payroll partners including Manchester NHS foundation trust who shared this on in an email to their 28,000 members. 

The tool includes full dynamically created tests for every postcode key value pair in the JSON file. Testing for spacing entry issues, case differences, postcodes in overlapping common bond areas and outside of any eligible common bond.
